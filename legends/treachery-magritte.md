This could well be used to explain the nature of requirements management and sw modeling. Be it a model, diagram, sw req specs document, none of those is the SW itself.

Despite that creating the requirements and making models can be useful. Before undertaking a big sw project, it is useful to have discussions and find out, what the client really needs.

But the picture cannot be run or used to run any business.

## Agile

The agile paradigm is one manifestation or application for the critique against the making big front extensive "pictures" of the sw instead of implementing the actual sw. Only working sw can give a proper understanding if the (implicit) requirements and needs are met or not.

However, sw specs has value, it is just question how much energy to consume for it.
