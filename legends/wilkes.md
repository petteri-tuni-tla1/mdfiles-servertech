# Maurice Wilkes. Memoirs of a computer pioneer

I well remember when this realization first came on me with full force. 
The EDSAC was on the top floor of the building and the tape-punching and 
editing equipment one floor below. ... 
It was on one of my journeys between the EDSAC room and the punching equipment 
that "hesitating at the angles of stairs" the realization came over me with 
full force that a good part of the remainder of my life was going to be spent 
in finding errors in my own programs.
